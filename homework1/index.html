                    Java is <abbr title="object oriented programming">OOP</abbr> language that unlike c does not need to be compiled to machine code to be executed. 
                    The java project started in 1991 and was called Oak. Later it was renamed to Green and at last it was renamed to the name we know it by today, Java.

                    Inorder to run Java on your computer you need to install the <abbr title="Java Developer Kit">JDK</abbr>.
                    In the <abbr title="Java Developer Kit">JDK</abbr> you will get the <abbr title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</abbr> which is needed
                    to run your Java code. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Source</a>)
